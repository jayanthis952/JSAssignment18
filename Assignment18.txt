In JavaScript, a generator is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed during execution, allowing you to generate a sequence of values on-the-fly.

A regular function, on the other hand, runs to completion and returns a value (if any) before exiting.

Here are some key differences between a generator function and a regular function:

Syntax: Generator functions are defined using the function* syntax, while regular functions are defined using the function syntax.

Execution: Generator functions can be paused and resumed during execution, allowing you to generate a sequence of values on-the-fly. Regular functions execute from start to finish in one go.

Return value: Generator functions can use the yield keyword to return a value and pause the execution of the function. Regular functions return a value using the return keyword and exit the function.

Multiple values: Generator functions can generate multiple values over time using the yield keyword, while regular functions can only return a single value.

Iteration: Generator functions are often used to create iterators that can be used to iterate over a sequence of values.

Here's an example of a generator function that generates an infinite sequence of numbers:

function* infiniteNumbers() {
  let n = 0;
  while (true) {
    yield n++;
  }
}
