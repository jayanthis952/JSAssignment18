No, function generators are not iterable by default in JavaScript. However, you can make them iterable by defining an @@iterator method on the generator function's prototype object, which returns the generator object itself.

Here's an example of how you can make a function generator iterable:
function* myGenerator() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

myGenerator.prototype[Symbol.iterator] = function() {
  return this;
}

for (let value of myGenerator()) {
  console.log(value);
}

Here's an example of how you can make a function generator iterable:

javascript
Copy code
function* myGenerator() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

myGenerator.prototype[Symbol.iterator] = function() {
  return this;
}

for (let value of myGenerator()) {
  console.log(value);
}
In this example, we define a function generator myGenerator that yields three values. Then, we define an @@iterator method on its prototype object, which simply returns the generator object itself. Finally, we use a for...of loop to iterate over the values generated by myGenerator.
